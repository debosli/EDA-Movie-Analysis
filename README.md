# **Movie Analysis Portfolio Project**

## **Overview**
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of a movie dataset to explore trends, identify the most profitable genres, and determine the best movies based on a combination of `vote_average`, `revenue`, and `success_metric`. The analysis highlights vital findings using data visualizations and is a strong example of data analysis and storytelling.

## **Objectives**
The primary goals of this project are:
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers in the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncover trends, relationships, and insights from the data.
- Top Movie Identification: Combine critical metrics to identify the best movies.
- Genre Profitability: Determine the most successful genres based on revenue and average ratings.
- Visualization: Provide clear, compelling visuals to support the findings.

## **Key Insights**
- Top Movies: Identified the best movies based on a combination of `vote_average`, `revenue`, and `success_metric`.
  - Example: *Avatar*, *The Dark Knight*, *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.
- Profitable Genres: Action and Adventure genres dominate total revenue, while History and Animation have the highest average ratings.
- Runtime & Rating: Runtime has a weak correlation with average votes, indicating viewer preference isn't strongly influenced by film length.

**File Structure**
- `data/`:
  - Contains the raw movie dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`:
  - Jupyter Notebook with the entire analysis workflow.
- `visuals/`:
  - Key graphs and visualizations generated during EDA.
- `README.md`:
  - Documentation and overview of the project.


**Technologies Used**
- Python:
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- Jupyter Notebook: This is for exploratory data analysis and visualizations.

**Visualizations**
Here are some examples of insights derived from the data:
1. Total Revenue by Genre:
   - Action and Adventure genres generate the highest revenue.
2. Average Rating by Genre:
   - History and Animation have the highest average ratings.
3. Budget vs Revenue Relationship:
   - A robust positive correlation between budget and revenue was observed.
